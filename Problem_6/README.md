![sum of the squares](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=1%5E2%2B2%5E2%2B...%2B10%5E2%3D385&bc=White&fc=Black&im=png&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=)

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

![square of the sum](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%281%2B2%2B...%2B10%292%3D552%3D3025&bc=White&fc=Black&im=png&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025−385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
